 logkeys keylogger - instalation instructions
===============================================================================

Provided your GNU/Linux distribution doesn't include logkeys package in its
repositories, manual installation of logkeys from source is as easy as:

 $ tar xvzf logkeys-0.1.0.tar.gz   # to extract the logkeys archive
 
 $ cd logkeys-0.1.0/build  # move to build directory to build there
 $ ../configure            # invoke configure from parent directory
 $ make                    # make compiles what it needs to compile
 ( become superuser now )  # you need root to install in system dir
 # make install            # installs binaries, manuals and scripts

That's it. 

To ever uninstall logkeys, remove accompanying scripts and manuals, issue

 # make uninstall    # in the same logkeys-0.1.0/build dir from before

See README file for usage instructions and notes.
